# Pico-Placa
Coding Exercise
Welcome to my app for Pico Y placa, As u can see we have a input you have to fill out with the number of the license plate car you want to know the info about, the date where you want your car to go out, and the time. If your car can go out it will print a message saying "El vehiculo puede circular" if not it will print a message saying "El vehiculo no puede circular". The answer is in spanish because this app is for people who live in Ecuador and follow the regulations of Pico y Placa. 

How did I create it?
First I started with an html to create the input where the user could put the values of the license plate number, date and time. After this I styled it with a little css so it looks clean and usable. And finally after I had all the "frontend" of the app I decided to use javscript as my backend based on the algorithm and datastructure of the problem, I created a code that allows me to validate whether a car can go out or not depending on the three variables I mentioned before.
